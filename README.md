Distributed Computing: Simulation for Leader election in Asynchronous networks

Build and run instructions
1. Unzip the file 'uxg140230.zip'
2. 'cd' to uxg140230 directory
3. Run run_algo.sh script. The script will build the source and runs the algorithm by reading the data from 'input.dat'
4. Output will be saved in the file 'output.dat'

TEST MACHINE: csgrads1.utdallas.edu
Compiler: java version 1.8.0_45-b14

Result: output.dat

NOTE: The algorithm is tested on csgrads1.utdallas.edu with the enclosed 'input.dat' file with 'java version 1.8.0_45-b14'
